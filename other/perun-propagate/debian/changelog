perun-propagate (3.0.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Add better timeout and test all hosts for perun_propagate
  * timeout doesn't end propagation, propagation will continue in background,
    only perun_propagation ends with info about it
  * script tries call remctl for every uniqe host in ktutils because of more 
    hosts for one physical address
